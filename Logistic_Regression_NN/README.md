# Logistic_NN
A simple neural network to determine whether a picture contains a cat or not. 
The network contains one activation node which uses a sigmoid function. It is built without the use of any neural network libraries, and was a part of my deeplearning.ai deep learning specialisation. I have altered the code slightly to help with quick application for similar projects.
