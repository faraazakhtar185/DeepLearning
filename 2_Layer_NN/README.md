# 2_Layer_NN
A neural network with 1 hidden layer to determine a non-linear decision boundary. 
The first layer has a tanh activation, while the second layer is a sigmoid activation. The network was created without any neural network libraries and was a part of my deeplearning.ai deep learning specialisation.
